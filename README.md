  *This model performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset containing movie reviews. The model uses three different algorithms - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) - to predict the sentiment of the movie reviews as positive or negative. The model also includes data cleaning and visualization techniques such as removing stopwords, stemming, creating a word cloud, and bar chart to show the most common words in positive reviews. *
